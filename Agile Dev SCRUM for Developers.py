# MAGIC - Agility in software development is a mindset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Product Owner
# MAGIC - needs to understand tech enought to communicate effectively
# MAGIC - senior BA are good candidates
# MAGIC - Product Owner vs Project Manager
# MAGIC   - Project Manager is not part of SCRUM team
# MAGIC   - Organization with SCRUM has project manager outside of SCRUM team
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### All team member in SCRUM team share management responsibility
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### SCRUM Team Member
# MAGIC - In SCRUM, specialist is welcome to be part of the team
# MAGIC - Specialist can be `I shape` (one deep understanding of a tech) or `T shape` (one deep understanding of one area and fair understanding of others)
# MAGIC - *Optimal team size follows two pizza rule. number of team member can fed by two pizza*
# MAGIC - Two Types of Teams
# MAGIC   - Feature Team
# MAGIC     - this type of team can handle diverse range of project
# MAGIC   - Component Team
# MAGIC     - this type of team is specialized on one type of task such as data analytics

# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Product Backlog
# MAGIC - Product backlog is prioritized by product owner
# MAGIC - **a useful way of prioritize the backlog is take a look at each items in backlog regarding how fine-grain each item is**
# MAGIC - product backlog exists as long as the product exist
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Sprint Backlog
# MAGIC - SCRUM works in sprint fashion, so each sprint there is a `sprint backlog`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Product Implement
# MAGIC - Integrated functional software that meets the `definition of done`, and it is ready to be released

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Component in a Sprint
# MAGIC - Backlog Refinement
# MAGIC   - Loosely defined in SCRUM guild
# MAGIC   - PO and Dev Team need attend
# MAGIC   - can be conducted by an event and should take less than `10%` of the dev team's time
# MAGIC   - Purposes
# MAGIC     - adding items to backlog 
# MAGIC     - review priority 
# MAGIC     - clarify requirement
# MAGIC - Sprint Planning
# MAGIC   - Usually takes 2 to 8 hours
# MAGIC   - two parts of the sprint planning are `define sprint goal` and `how to achieve goal in the sprint`
# MAGIC   - **Sprint Goal has to be SMART goal**
# MAGIC   - It is team member's responsbility to add detail plan / task; 
# MAGIC   - **the ultimate goal of sprint planning is to set sprint backlog**
# MAGIC - Daily Standup
# MAGIC   - SCRUM master can facilitate / participate but not mando; dev team can conduct it anyway they want
# MAGIC   - **duration should be 15 mins, it SHOULD NOT become problem solving session, it SHOULD NOT involve any stakeholder just dev team**
# MAGIC   - answers 
# MAGIC     - what I did previous day
# MAGIC     - what I plan to do today
# MAGIC     - Are there any roadblock
# MAGIC - Sprint Review
# MAGIC   - It is an event that SCRUM team and external stakeholders - `4 hours for 1 month sprint (shorter for shorter sprint length)`
# MAGIC   - Answer `where we stand - progress?` and `what next?`
# MAGIC   - Purposes: 
# MAGIC     - Inspect product increment (items finished in sprint's backlog)
# MAGIC - Sprint Retrospective
# MAGIC   - **inspect anything other than product increment - AKA team performance review**
# MAGIC   - `what went well`, `what not went well`, and `what can be better`
# MAGIC   - Don't skip this component
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Objective of a Sprint
# MAGIC - Each sprint must end with `product increment` which might released to stakeholders
# MAGIC   - `product increment` should be end to end functional and provide business value
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Special types of Sprint
# MAGIC - `Sprint Zero`: the very first sprint that dedicate to sprint planning
# MAGIC - `Hardening Sprint`: the sprint dedicate to fix bugs and fine tunning features
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Technicle Debt
# MAGIC - What is tech debt? 
# MAGIC   - when you create a feature for the first time, you didn't realize how often this feature will be reused; so you need rebuild and refactor your code for better scalability
# MAGIC   - when important programming language has a major version update and you need adapt your code to newer version
# MAGIC   - You need tranform a quick short term solution to long term friendly code
# MAGIC - How to address tech debt 
# MAGIC   - make those debts visible to stakeholders, they need understand why it is important to address those debt
# MAGIC   - address ASAP
